This page contains information related to our project, ChartMyCourse.

### Project Summary

Navigating college is hard. Navigating the choices of classes is even harder. Chart My Course seeks to simplify a Baylor Computer Science studentâ€™s choices of courses to take, as well as professors that teach them.

### Project Goals
We intend to create a utility similar to the now defunct [BUBooks](http://bubooks.com/) that aggregates reviews of not just the course offerings, but also professor/course pairings. This utility is intended to give potential students a realistic look at what sort of coursework or workload they can expect in a class.
